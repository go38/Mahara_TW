<h3>HTML editor</h3>
<p>An HTML editor is available for some sections of the site. This is known as a 'What you see is what you get' (WYSIWYG) editor. This allows the user to apply formatting to text, e.g. bold or italics. If the editor is turned off, the user can only enter plain text.</p>
<p>This setting might be disabled by a site administrator.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> HTML editors may appear and work slightly differently in some browsers.</p>
