<h3>Publicly viewable group</h3>
<p>If you tick this checkbox, most sections of your group will be visible to anyone who visits your group - including people who do not have an account on this site.</p>
<p>Everyone will be able to see all discussions in the forums. However, people will still have to become a member of the group before they can post to them. The listing of group members may be restricted by the group administrator.</p>
<p>Regardless of this setting, your group files area and all files inside it will remain visible only to group members.</p>
