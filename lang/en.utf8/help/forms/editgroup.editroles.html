<h3>Editing pages</h3>
<p>You can choose which roles will be allowed to create and edit pages owned by the group. If your group contains only members and administrators, then "Group admins" and "Everyone except members" are identical.</p>

<p>These edit permissions will also be used by default for new group files. Permissions can be changed on individual files in the group files area.</p>
